The content of the prototype:
1. The timer and the record of best time are incompletely implemented.
2. There are total 5 levels for the game, but now the prototype only shows the level 1.
3. When the words match with the pictures, they will disappear together. But now I'm still 
figuring out how to do that.

The task for the prototype:
1. Read the instruction on the homepage, and click the button to begin the game.
2. Read the instruction on the gamepage, and follow the instruction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
1. Add "About"page and "Contact" page.
2. Instead of 5 levels for a game, I changed it to just 1 level for each game.
3. Also, instead of the record of the best time, I changed to record the last time by using cookie.
