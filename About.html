  <p class="introduction">
  Hoping you enjoy playing Everday English Plus!<br><br>
  The game is for foreigners who would like to recognize and learn the everyday local English around them.<br><br>
  As an international student, I frequently faced something that I could not tell the name in English
  even though I knew the name in Chinese. Thus, I came up with the idea that I believe it would help
  foreigners to learn the language of daily stuff actively.<br><br>
  A fun and interesting way would be provided to help you better recognize and remember
  the daily name of stuff or matter in English. On the homepage,
  there are three different categories of everyday stuff that you could choose to learn.
  Each category has a small game that you could play and learn everyday English! <br><br>

  Cheers! :)
